# Burger Builder

[WIP] This fun project was developed primarily for me to practice React, React routing, Redux and test writing. It allows users to dynamically customise a burger and place an order. This order is saved to a Firebase database and can be retrieved on-demand.

## Requirements

- Some of the libraries imported and used:
  - `react`
  - `react-router-dom`
  - `react-redux` - WIP
  - `axios`
  - `eslint`
  - `prettier`

## App features

- Navbar and side drawer for navigation.
- Saves orders to Firebase database via Axios. Orders can subsequently be retrieved.
- Routing within SPA with React Router.
- Axios interceptors to handle errors on app-wide basis via a higher order component (withErrorHandler).
- State management with Redux. - WIP.
- WIP

## Getting started

- Install Node.js and Yarn if you don't already have them installed.
- In this directory, run `yarn install`.
- Start the React server in terminal with `yarn start`.
